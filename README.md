Respiration is a vital biological process essential for sustaining life. It provides oxygen to the body and removes carbon dioxide produced during metabolism. Normal adult humans typically breathe between 12–20 breaths per minute (BPM), and deviations from this range may indicate abnormal physiological conditions. Disorders such as sleep apnea, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory depression are strongly associated with irregular breathing patterns. In many cases, timely detection of abnormal breathing can prevent medical emergencies, reduce mortality rates, and improve overall patient care. Traditionally, respiratory monitoring has been carried out in clinical environments using hospital-grade equipment such as polysomnography machines, spirometers, and capnographs. While these devices are accurate but they are expensive, bulky, and inaccessible to a majority of patients outside hospitals. Furthermore, many of these systems are designed for diagnostic evaluation rather than continuous or home-based monitoring. The rise of Internet of Things (IoT), low-cost sensors, and microcontrollers makes it feasible to design such solutions. The Smart Breath Monitoring Device is one such attempt to bridge this gap by combining piezoelectric sensing technology with an ESP32 microcontroller, enabling real-time respiratory monitoring with alert mechanisms.
